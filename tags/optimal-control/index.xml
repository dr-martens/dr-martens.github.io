      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to control a desired dynamics or pattern has attracted considerable attention over the last decades. Often, the applied control signals are treated as weak perturbations and an equation of motion for perturbed solution in response to the applied controls is derived. Recently, we&#39;ve posed the inverse question of how to design controls that lead to a propagation of the solution following a desired velocity protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, we&#39;ve proposed an open loop control of wave patterns that acts solely via the Goldstone modes of the system and provides analytical expressions for the control signal to be applied; we coin this approach &lt;em&gt;Goldstone control&lt;/em&gt;. We demonstrated that the latter is able to accelerate or decelerate 1D traveling front and pulse solutions as well as localized spot solutions to 2D reaction-diffusion equations without changing their spatial profile. Moreover, it applies to move the core of a spiral wave at desired velocity along a pre-given trajectory through a 2D spatial domain or to shape iso-concentration lines of 2D traveling pulses. Additionally, we confirmed the optimality of Goldstone control by demonstrating  numerically its equivalence to the solution of an  optimal control problem. To solve the latter, the analytical expressions for the control are excellent initial guesses; substantially speeding-up the time-consuming calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
