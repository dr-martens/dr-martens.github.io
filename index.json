For measurements across a whole range of values, this can be done by comparing their straight-line fit to the identity line. Such a comparison is only meaningful, when uncertainties are available. Furthermore, the estimates of the straight-line fit and their uncertainties are only reliable when all sources of uncertainty have been accounted for. In particular, the measurements of both methods in a comparison are usually uncertain, and common instruments or standards cause correlation among or between them.\nWhen fitting a straight-line relation, the weighted total least-squares (WTLS) method accounts for correlation and uncertainties in both variables. This example focuses on WTLS and defines a measurement model from it to propagate all uncertainties and correlations through to the estimate of the slope and intercept, and associate uncertainties with them according to the GUM. Using the example of two high  accuracy methods measuring the total haemoglobin concentration in blood, i.e. the cyanmethaemoglobin and alkaline haematin method, we indicate how correlations can be inferred, demonstrate how they can be accounted for and show their impact on the regression. The results are discussed and recommendations are given. abstract_short: This example addresses the straight-line calibration of a torque measuring sensor against a reference system using measurements taken at different torque values. The data are analysed by applying (i) ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation in combination with an uncertainty evaluation following the GUM and (ii) Bayesian inference.","tags":["regression","uncertainty evaluation","GUM","WTLS"],"title":"Quantifying uncertainty when comparing measurement methods – Haemoglobin concentration as an example of correlation in straight-line regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Katy Klauenberg","Clemens Elster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592956800,"objectID":"2b1342d3a0fba0ee910f109976d8a98f","permalink":"/talk/vdi2020-1/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/vdi2020-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Least-squares estimation","Uncertainty evaluation","GUM","Bayesian regression"],"title":"Talk: Kalibrierung eines Drehmomentmesssystems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Katy Klauenberg","Clemens Elster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590451200,"objectID":"45d1fdcf2838157866b413e68c669fb8","permalink":"/publication/manual/2020-05-26_calibrationuncertaintygumvsbayesian/","publishdate":"2020-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/manual/2020-05-26_calibrationuncertaintygumvsbayesian/","section":"publication","summary":"This example addresses the straight-line calibration of a torque measuring sensor against a reference system using measurements taken at different torque values.

This makes them a convenient tool to describe various neural processes, such as working memory, motion perception, and visual hallucinations, to name a few. Due to the important applications, the question arises of how to effectively control solutions in such systems. In this work, we investigate the problem of position control of traveling wave solutions to scalar neural field equations on the basis of singular perturbation analysis. Thereby, we consider different means of control, such as spatio-temporal modulations of the neural firing threshold, asymmetric synaptic coupling kernels, and additive inputs. Treating these controls as perturbations to the neural field system, one obtains an equation of motion for traveling wave solutions in response to the applied controls. Subsequently, we pose the inverse question of how to design controls that lead to a propagation of the solution following a desired velocity protocol. In particular, we make use of a specific excitation of the solution's translational modes [J. Löber and H. Engel, Phys. Rev. Lett., 112 (2014), 148305] which enables an explicit calculation of a necessary control signal for a given velocity protocol without evoking shape deformations. Moreover, we derive an equivalent control method relying on a modulation of the neurons' synaptic footprint.","tags":["Inverse Problems","Neural Field Equations"],"title":"Control of nonlinear wave solutions to neural field equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Katy Klauenberg","Clemens Elster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557792000,"objectID":"dcaeb10640e907cb23130994e646daea","permalink":"/talk/vdi2019-1/","publishdate":"2019-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/vdi2019-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Errors-in-Variables","Least-squares estimation","Uncertainty evaluation"],"title":"Talk: EMUE Projekt","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Katy Klauenberg","Clemens Elster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553644800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553644800,"objectID":"9452291b081d6aeb9ab9b4305039d3d7","permalink":"/talk/berlin2019-1/","publishdate":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/berlin2019-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk: Straight line regression in Errors-in-Variables Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Katy Klauenberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550534400,"objectID":"af43e8dd5f0003572a5bee367a919bea","permalink":"/talk/ptbberlin2019-1/","publishdate":"2019-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ptbberlin2019-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Errors-in-Variables","Bayesian regression"],"title":"Seminar: Straight line regression in Errors in Variables Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let's make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

In particular, neural field systems exhibit self-organized spatio-temporal structures, such as stationary and traveling fronts and pulses, spiral waves, and localized spot-like bump solutions. This makes them a convenient tool to describe various neural processes, such as working memory, motion perception and visual hallucinations, to name a few. Due to the important applications of neural field models, the question arises how to effectively control solutions in these systems.\nIn order to address this problem, we extend analytic control techniques, previously derived for reaction-diffusion systems [J. Löber, PRL 112, 148305; arXiv:1703.04246], to neural field equations. The proposed open-loop control scheme enables shifting and rotating traveling bump and wave solutions according to a prescribed protocol of motion while simultaneously conserving their shape. Noteworthy, the control signal solely depends on the profile and velocity of the unperturbed solution, and thus, for applying the control scheme, a detailed knowledge of the internal dynamics is not required.","tags":[],"title":"Talk: Control of Wave Propagation in Neural Field Equations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen

investigate wave propagation in rotationally symmetric tubes with a periodic spatial modulation of cross section. Using an asymptotic perturbation analysis, the governing quasi-two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation can be reduced into a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion-advection equation. Assuming a weak perturbation by the advection term and using projection method, in a second step, an equation of motion for traveling waves within such tubes can be derived. Both methods predict properly the nonlinear dependence of the propagation velocity on the ratio of the modulation period of the geometry to the intrinsic width of the front, or pulse. As a main feature, we observe finite intervals of propagation failure of waves induced by the tube’s modulation and derive an analytically tractable condition for their occurrence. For the highly diffusive limit, using the Fick-Jacobs approach, we show that wave velocities within modulated tubes are governed by an effective diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of a single bottleneck on the period of pulse trains. We observe period changes by integer fractions dependent on the bottleneck width and the period of the entering pulse train.","tags":["Inverse Problems","Confinement","Reaction-Diffusion Equations"],"title":"Wave propagation in spatially modulated tubes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

In modern separation devices various kind of forces are used to separate size-dispersed objects, e.g., colloids, cells, or DNA, on micro- or even nanoscales. Often, the motion of these objects proceeds within confining geometries like in Lab-on-Chip devices, microfluidic channels, or vector chromatography arrays. In particular, for uneven boundaries entropic effects caused by non-holomic constraints are important. A deep understanding of these entropic contribution is significant in order to effectively control particle transport at microscale level. In view of its importance, recent efforts in theory triggered activities which allow for an approximate description that involves a reduction of dimensionality; thus making detailed predictions tractable. Up to present days, the focus was on the role of conservative forces and its interplay with confinement.\nRecently, we overcame this limitation and derived a generalization of the Fick-Jacobs approach for the most general force which can involve both, the curl-free and the divergence-free components. Particularly, the latter is essential for particle transport caused by e.g. laminar solvent flows or dielectrophoretic forces. For arbitrarily corrugated channel geometry, one can put forward an effective one-dimensional description involving the potential of mean force, which along with the commonly known entropic contribution in presence of a constant bias, acquires a qualitatively novel contribution associated with divergence-free forces.\nA relevant application is the fluid flow across microfludic structures where a solute of Brownian particles is subject to both, an external bias and a pressure-driven flow. At a critical ratio of these counteracting tendencies, the mean particle current can identically vanish, despite the presence of locally strong forces, and being accompanied by a colossal suppression of diffusion. This in turn yields our major finding; namely, the phenomenon of hydrodynamically enforced entropic trapping (HEET) of Brownian particles. HEET offers a unique opportunity to efficiently separate particles of the same size based on their different response to the applied constant stimuli, e.g., to sift healthy cells from diseased and dead cells. Even small distinctions in the response can be used to trap a certain particle \u0026ldquo;species\u0026rdquo; and achieve opposite transport directions for the other \u0026ldquo;specie\u0026rdquo;. The corrugation of the boundaries is a crucial prerequisite for the function of an entropic sieve. For straight channels, which represents the typical studied geometry for Poiseuille flow, HEET cannot be observed.\nWe stress that my methodology admits the situation of a driven solvent; alternatively, similar effects can be expected in a resting solvent with nonvanishing divergence-free forces.\n","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"2d6235aa3f3e11b1122aa2b7b6024016","permalink":"/project/heet/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/heet/","section":"project","summary":"Effective control of mass and charge transport in confined media.","tags":["Confinement","Entropic Transport","HEET"],"title":"Hydrodynamically enforced entropic trapping","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The ability to control a desired dynamics or pattern has attracted considerable attention over the last decades. Often, the applied control signals are treated as weak perturbations and an equation of motion for perturbed solution in response to the applied controls is derived. Recently, we've posed the inverse question of how to design controls that lead to a propagation of the solution following a desired velocity protocol.\nIn doing so, we've proposed an open loop control of wave patterns that acts solely via the Goldstone modes of the system and provides analytical expressions for the control signal to be applied; we coin this approach Goldstone control. We demonstrated that the latter is able to accelerate or decelerate 1D traveling front and pulse solutions as well as localized spot solutions to 2D reaction-diffusion equations without changing their spatial profile.

Two limiting cases are considered in detail, namely, when the constant drive is parallel to the principal or the diagonal array axes. This corresponds to studying the Brownian transport in periodic channels with reflecting walls of different topologies. The mobility and diffusivity of the transported particle in such channels are determined as functions of the drive and the array geometric parameters. Prominent transport features, like negative differential mobilities, excess diffusion peaks, and unconventional asymptotic behaviors, are explained in terms of two distinct lengths, the size of single obstacles (trapping length) and the lattice constant of the array (local correlation length). Local correlation effects are further analyzed by continuously rotating the drive between the two limiting orientations.","tags":[],"title":"Talk: Driven Brownian transport through arrays of symmetric obstacles","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","Igor M Sokolov","Lutz Schimansky-Geier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"99dc94fe606c9381f94db3afd018b64a","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2012-01-01_communication_impact/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2012-01-01_communication_impact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Confinement","Entropic Transport"],"title":"Communication: Impact of inertia on biased Brownian transport in confined geometries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pulak K Ghosh","Peter H\u0026auml;nggi","Fabio Marchesoni","Steffen Martens","Franco Nori","Lutz Schimansky-Geier","Gerhard Schmid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"10bf459584e9120d809140e4783719c6","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2012-01-01_driven_brownian_tran/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2012-01-01_driven_brownian_tran/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Confinement","Entropic Transport"],"title":"Driven Brownian transport through arrays of symmetric obstacles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"fbd1f9958aa3ad245503d9fe8a1f328f","permalink":"/talk/krakau2012-1/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/krakau2012-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Poster:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"00ad49ba7bc3e83f0db7863ef35a73b1","permalink":"/talk/huberlin2012-1/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/huberlin2012-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seminar:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"90a9d74130738d3045546d109e0d1865","permalink":"/talk/berlin2012-1/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/berlin2012-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"06b3cc47ba864be7e7b0292b7822e37f","permalink":"/talk/berlin2012-2/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/berlin2012-2/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1315785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1315785600,"objectID":"86074d35aaab231397039c2179c33280","permalink":"/talk/palmademallorca2011-1/","publishdate":"2011-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/palmademallorca2011-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk: Biased Brownian Motion in Conﬁned Geometries","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1302480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1302480000,"objectID":"acd23fe7f6d3ee0cfd190b4978b06a42","permalink":"/talk/mpidresden2011-1/","publishdate":"2011-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mpidresden2011-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Poster: Entropic transport -

Interestingly, the phenomenom of negative resistance is found, i.e. the mobility possesses a minimum at a finite value of the strength of the thermal fluctuations for a given overcritical external driving force.","tags":[],"title":"Poster: Resonance-like phenomena of the mobility of a chain of nonlinear coupled oscillators in a two-dimensional periodic potential","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens","D Hennig","S Fugmann","L Schimansky-Geier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"494c75fb19905ad2ad7ff4b6fc0320d4","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2008-01-01_resonancelike_phenom/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2008-01-01_resonancelike_phenom/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["thermally activated transport"],"title":"Resonancelike phenomena in the mobility of a chain of nonlinear coupled oscillators in a two-dimensional periodic potential","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"d75addbfbd1ef74a8522c284f6b2b338","permalink":"/talk/berlin2008-1/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/berlin2008-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"c7b8d2cf6326ca0bde220c6b2306e7d5","permalink":"/talk/berlin2008-2/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/berlin2008-2/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Talk:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["D Hennig","Steffen Martens","S Fugmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"99e5413cefc839c8717c5441b87876e9","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2008-01-01_transition_between_l/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2008-01-01_transition_between_l/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Transition between locked and running states for dimer motion induced by periodic external driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"a0da2cadec4d41e9e50047f7e130dc59","permalink":"/talk/graal-muritz2007-1/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/graal-muritz2007-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seminar:","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Steffen Martens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"f13bea8eb91ae3de4c4d8d6c99c855db","permalink":"/talk/huberlin2007-1/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/huberlin2007-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seminar:","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\rCalibration of a torque measuring system – GUM uncertainty evaluation for least-squares versus Bayesian inference\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rcode{white-space: pre;}\rpre:not([class]) {\rbackground-color: white;\r}\r\rif (window.hljs) {\rhljs.configure({languages: []});\rhljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();\rif (document.readyState \u0026\u0026 document.readyState === \"complete\") {\rwindow.setTimeout(function() { hljs.initHighlighting();

For each torque value, a single measurement result of the reference system is available, together with results of repeated measurements of sensor that shall be calibrated. The goal is to determine a linear relationship that relates results of the torque measuring sensor with those of the reference system. The data are analyzed by applying (i) ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation in combination with an uncertainty evaluation following the GUM and (ii) Bayesian inference. Analytic expressions are given for the Bayesian uncertainty analysis which simplifies its application. The results obtained by the different approaches are discussed and recommendations given.\n\r2 Introduction of the application\rStraight-line calibration of a torque measuring sensor, which are made of a strain gauges, against a reference system is addressed. The data are partly taken from example B2 of the guideline VDI/VDE 2600 part 2 [1]. The goal of the calibration is to determine a functional relationship between results obtained by the sensor and those of a reference system. Measurements have been carried out at different values of torque by the considered sensor and the reference system. For each torque value, a single measurement has been conducted by the reference system and a number of repeated measurements by the considered sensor. Table 2.1 shows the data, where repeated measurement results of the sensor have been summarized through their means and standard deviations, respectively. For further details about the measurements the reader is referred to [1].\nThis example provides guidance for the evaluation of uncertainty in the estimation of a calibration curve from data like those in table 2.1. Two approaches are provided: (i) ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation (see, e.g., ISO 28037 [2]) accompanied with an uncertainty evaluation based on the GUM [3], and (ii) a statistical approach applying Bayesian inference (cf., for example, [4]). Explicit expressions are given for the Bayesian uncertainty analysis which simplifies its application.\n\u0026gt; data \u0026lt;- read.csv(file=\u0026quot;data_A242.csv\u0026quot;,\r+ header = TRUE,\r+ quote = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\r+ sep = \u0026quot;;\u0026quot;,\r+ dec = \u0026quot;.\u0026quot;,\r+ skipNul = TRUE,\r+ strip.white = TRUE, #strip out extra white space in strings\r+ stringsAsFactors=FALSE\r+ )\r\u0026gt; Nsample \u0026lt;- nrow(data)\r\u0026gt; # manually rename column names\r\u0026gt; names(data)[names(data)==\u0026quot;mean.y\u0026quot;] \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;\r\u0026gt; names(data)[names(data)==\u0026quot;SD.S\u0026quot;] \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;S\u0026quot;\rTable 2.1:  Summary statistics for part1 of the measurement data given in the guideline [1].

The dashed line represents the identity \\(y = x\\).\r\r\n\r3 Specification of the measurand\rLet \\(X\\) denote the applied torque, in what follows called stimulus, and \\(Y\\) the corresponding quantity measured by the considered sensor, below denoted as response. The linear relation\n\\[\\begin{align}\rY= \\beta X \\tag{3.1}\r\\end{align}\\]\ris assumed to model the relationship between the measured responses of the considered sensor and the applied stimulus. Model (3.1) represents a straight line with zero offset. The latter has been chosen for physical reasons which is supported by the observed data, see figure 2.1. The measurand is the slope parameter \\(\\beta\\) of the particular straight line model (3.1). The input quantities are \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_p\\) (with \\(p=8\\) in our example) which correspond to the measurement results at the considered torques \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_p\\). The variability associated with the measurement results \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_p\\) of the reference device are considered as small enough so that they can be neglected.\n\r4 Measurement model\rThe uncertainty evaluations presented in this example are based on two different models. The uncertainty evaluation following the GUM in connection with ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation is based on a measurement model in which the measurand is represented as a function of the input quantities. An estimate of the measurand is then obtained by evaluating this measurement model using the estimates of the input quantities. The uncertainty associated with the resulting estimate for the measurand results from a propagation of the uncertainties associated with the estimates of the input quantities through this measurement model.\nThe Bayesian inference is based on a statistical model for the observed data, and the measurand enters as one of the parameters of the statistical model. The Bayesian inference can account for prior knowledge about the measurand. It results in a probability distribution for the measurand which can be viewed as the final complete result. Mean and standard deviation of that distribution can be taken as an estimate and standard uncertainty for the measurand. Bayesian uncertainty analysis can be viewed as being reached through the Bayesian inference, rather than by a process of propagating input uncertainties through a measurement model in the sense of the GUM.\n4.1 Ordinary and weighted least-squares\rApplication of weighted least-squares estimation determines an estimate \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) for the measurand by minimizing\r\\[\\begin{align} Q = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} W_i (y_{ij}-\\beta x_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^p W_i \\lbrace n_i (y_i-\\beta x_i)^2+ (n_i-1) S_i^2 \\rbrace\r\\tag{4.1}\r\\end{align}\\]\rwith respect to \\(\\beta\\). In (4.1), \\(y_i\\) and \\(S_i\\) represent mean and standard deviation of the repeated measurement results \\(y_{ij}, j=1, \\ldots,n_i\\), of the considered sensor at the \\(i\\)-th stimulus \\(x_i\\), and \\(W_i\\) denote some weights, \\(i=1,\\ldots,p\\). The solution \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) to this minimization problem is given by\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\widehat{\\beta} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i^2\\right)^{-1}\\,\\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i y_i. \\tag{4.2}\r\\end{align}\\]\rThe measurement model will now be defined as\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\beta = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i^2\\right)^{-1}\\, \\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i Y_i,\r\\tag{4.3}\r\\end{align}\\]\ri.e., by replacing the estimates \\(y_i\\) in (4.2) with corresponding quantities \\(Y_i\\). Note that a measurement model in the sense of the GUM is always a model between quantities. Since the estimates \\(x_i\\) of the stimulus are treated as being exact, the actual quantity \\(X_i\\) in (4.3) has already been replaced with the known values \\(x_i\\) in this example. Ordinary least-squares estimation is obtained by choosing weights \\(W_i=1, i=1,\\ldots,p\\).\n\r4.2 Statistical model\rA statistical model specifies the distribution from which the observed data is taken as a realization. The subsequent statistical model assumes that all single measurements \\(y_{ij},j=1,\\ldots,n_i, i=1, \\ldots, p\\), are realizations of independently and normally distributed random variables \\(Y_{ij}\\) with means equal \\(\\beta\\, x_i\\) and variances \\(\\sigma_i^2\\), i.e.\r\\[\\begin{align}\rY_{ij}| \\beta, \\sigma_i^2 \\sim N \\left( \\beta\\, x_i, \\sigma_i^2 \\right).\r\\tag{4.4}\r\\end{align}\\]\rIn (4.4), the \\(x_i\\) denote the known stimuli and the \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) the unknown variances to be inferred.\nThe likelihood function is the probability for the observed data viewed as a function of the unknown parameters. For the statistical model (4.4) the likelihood function is given by\r\\[\\begin{align}\rl(\\beta, \\vec{\\sigma}^2; \\mathrm{data}) \\propto \\prod_{i=1}^p (\\sigma_i^2)^{-n_i/2} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma_i^2} [(n_i-1) S_i^2 + n_i (y_i-\\beta x_i)^2] \\right)\\,,\r\\tag{4.5}\r\\end{align}\\]\rwhere \\(\\vec{\\sigma}^2=(\\sigma_1^2, \\ldots, \\sigma_p^2)^\\top\\), \\(y_i\\) and \\(S_i\\) denote mean and standard deviation of \\(y_{ij},j=1,\\ldots, n_i\\), and ``data’’ summarizes the sufficient statistics \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_p, S_1, \\ldots, S_p\\) of the data, see table 2.1.\n\r\r5 Estimation and uncertainty evaluation\r5.1 GUM uncertainty propagation\rThe measurement model in (4.3) contains input quantities \\(Y_i,i=1, \\ldots, p\\). For each of these input quantities a series of repeated measurement results \\(y_{ij}, j=1, \\ldots, n_i\\) is available. In following the GUM, mean and scaled standard deviation \\(S_i/\\sqrt{n_i}\\) are taken as estimate \\(y_i\\) and associated standard uncertainty \\(u(y_i)\\) for \\(Y_i\\). The estimates and standard uncertainties for the input quantities are listed in table 5.1.\n\u0026gt; # calculate standard uncertainty\r\u0026gt; data \u0026lt;- data %\u0026gt;% mutate(uy = round(S/sqrt(ndata), digits = 4))\rAccording to the GUM [3], the estimate \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) for \\(\\beta\\) is taken as value of the measurement model (4.3) when inserting the estimates from table 5.1 for the input quantities, i.e.\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\widehat{\\beta} = (\\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i^2)^{-1}\\,\\sum_{i=1}^p n_i W_i x_i y_i. \\tag{5.1}\r\\end{align}\\]\rThe (squared) standard uncertainty is obtained by\r\\[\\begin{align}\ru^2(\\widehat{\\beta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial Y_i}\\Big|_{Y_i=y_i}\\right)^2 u^2(y_i)\r\\tag{5.2}\r\\end{align}\\]\rIf the weights are chosen according to \\(n_i W_i= 1/u^2(y_{i})\\), one obtains\r\\[\\begin{align}\ru^2(\\widehat{\\beta}) =\u0026amp; \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^p \\frac{x_i^2}{u(y_i)^2}\\right)^{-1},\r\\tag{5.3}\r\\end{align}\\]\rand for ordinary least-squares estimation with \\(W_i=1\\)\r\\[\\begin{align}\ru^2(\\widehat{\\beta}) =\u0026amp; \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^p (n_i x_i)^2 u^2(y_i)}{(\\sum_{i=1}^p (n_i x_i)^2)^2}. \\tag{5.4}\r\\end{align}\\]\rAssuming a Gaussian distribution for \\(\\beta\\), a \\(95\\%\\) coverage interval is given by\r\\[\\begin{align}\r[\\widehat{\\beta}-1.96 u(\\widehat{\\beta}), \\widehat{\\beta}+1.96 u(\\widehat{\\beta})].\r\\tag{5.5}\r\\end{align}\\]\rTable 5.1: For the data in table 2.1 and measurement model (4.3), the estimate and standard uncertainty is listed for each input quantity (N m).\r\r\r\rInput quantity\r\r\\(Y_1\\)\r\r\\(Y_2\\)\r\r\\(Y_3\\)\r\r\\(Y_4\\)\r\r\\(Y_5\\)\r\r\\(Y_6\\)\r\r\\(Y_7\\)\r\r\\(Y_8\\)\r\r\r\r\r\rEstimate \\(y_i\\)\r\r0.0950\r\r0.1966\r\r0.3016\r\r0.4983\r\r1.0083\r\r3.0266\r\r4.0466\r\r5.0666\r\r\r\rStandard uncertainty \\(u(y_i)\\)\r\r0.0022\r\r0.0021\r\r0.0017\r\r0.0017\r\r0.0040\r\r0.0033\r\r0.0049\r\r0.0219\r\r\r\r\r\u0026gt; ## Ordinary or weighted least-squares method for straight line regression without\r\u0026gt; ## intercept\r\u0026gt; reg.OLS \u0026lt;- function(xin, yin, weights = NULL, uy = NULL) {\r+ if (nargs() \u0026lt; 2) {\r+ stop(\u0026quot;not enough input parameters\u0026quot;)\r+ }\r+ + l.data \u0026lt;- length(xin)\r+ if (l.data != length(yin)) {\r+ stop(\u0026quot;reg.OLS: length of xin and yin data is not the same\u0026quot;)\r+ }\r+ + if (is.null(weights)) {\r+ stop(\u0026quot;reg.OLS: weights are missing\u0026quot;)\r+ } else if (length(weights) == 1) {\r+ weights \u0026lt;- rep(weights, l.data)\r+ }\r+ inv.weights \u0026lt;- diag(x = weights)\r+ + if (is.null(uy)) {\r+ stop(\u0026quot;reg.OLS: uncertainties associated to y are missing\u0026quot;)\r+ } else if (length(uy) == 1) {\r+ uy \u0026lt;- rep(uy, l.data)\r+ }\r+ + fact \u0026lt;- 1/sum(weights * (xin^2))\r+ b.opt \u0026lt;- fact * sum(weights * xin * yin)\r+ ub \u0026lt;- sqrt((fact^2) * sum((weights * xin * uy)^2))\r+ + # R-square value\r+ R2 \u0026lt;- 1 - sum((yin - b.opt * xin)^2)/sum((yin - mean(yin))^2)\r+ # chi squared value\r+ chi2 \u0026lt;- sum(weights * (yin - b.opt * xin)^2)\r+ + nu \u0026lt;- length(xin) - 1 # degree of freedom\r+ + return(list(b = b.opt, ub = ub, PSI.low = b.opt - 1.96 * ub, PSI.up = b.opt + + 1.96 * ub, R2 = R2, chi.obs = chi2, S = chi2/nu # chi-squared per degree of freedom\r+ ))\r+ }\r\u0026gt; # OLS regression with weights W_i'=n_i\r\u0026gt; OLS \u0026lt;- reg.OLS(data$x, data$y, weights = data$ndata, uy = data$uy) %\u0026gt;% as.data.frame() %\u0026gt;% + mutate(method = \u0026quot;OLS-GUM\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; \u0026gt; ## WLS regression with weights W_i'=n_i/u(y_i)^2\r\u0026gt; WLS \u0026lt;- reg.OLS(data$x, data$y, weights = data$ndata/(data$uy^2), uy = data$uy) %\u0026gt;% + as.data.frame() %\u0026gt;% mutate(method = \u0026quot;WLS-GUM\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; \u0026gt; stat.methods \u0026lt;- bind_rows(OLS, WLS) %\u0026gt;% select(method, b, ub, PSI.low, PSI.up)\r\r5.2 Bayesian uncertainty analysis\rIn a Bayesian inference one combines the prior knowledge about the measurand (and other unknowns) with the information contained in the data through application of Bayes’ theorem. The result is the posterior distribution which summarizes the knowledge about the measurand (and other unknowns in the statistical model (4.4)) conditional on the observed data. In our case, the posterior is given through the following probability density function (PDF)\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\pi(\\beta,\\vec{\\sigma}^2 | \\mathrm{data}) \\propto \\pi(\\beta,\\vec{\\sigma}^2) l(\\beta, \\vec{\\sigma}^2; \\mathrm{data}),\r\\tag{5.6}\r\\end{align}\\]\rwhere \\(l(\\beta, \\vec{\\sigma}^2; \\mathrm{data})\\) denotes the likelihood function (4.5) for the assumed statistical model (4.4), and \\(\\pi(\\beta,\\vec{\\sigma}^2)\\) the employed prior for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\vec{\\sigma}^2=(\\sigma_1^2, \\ldots,\\sigma_p^2)^\\top\\). From the joint posterior (5.6), the marginal posterior \\(\\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data})\\) for the measurand is obtained through marginalization according to\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data}) =\r\\int_0^{\\infty} \\ldots \\int_0^{\\infty}\r\\pi(\\beta,\\vec{\\sigma}^2 | \\mathrm{data})\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_1^2 \\ldots \\mathrm{d} \\sigma_p^2.\r\\tag{5.7}\r\\end{align}\\]\rThe marginal posterior (5.7) is a PDF that can be seen as the complete Bayesian uncertainty analysis for the measurand. Summary statistics of this PDF may be sufficient in many cases, and one can consider in line with the GUM the posterior mean,\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\widehat{\\beta} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\pi(\\beta|\\mathrm{data}) \\beta\\, \\mathrm{d} \\beta\r\\tag{5.8}\r\\end{align}\\]\ras the Bayesian estimate, and the posterior standard deviation as the associated standard uncertainty \\(u(\\beta)\\), where\r\\[\\begin{align}\ru^2(\\beta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\pi(\\beta|\\mathrm{data}) (\\beta-\\widehat{\\beta})^2 \\mathrm{d} \\beta .\r\\tag{5.9}\r\\end{align}\\]\rNote that from a Bayesian point of view the standard uncertainty characterizes the uncertainty about the quantity \\(\\beta\\), rather than the uncertainty about its estimate \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) (which is known exactly). For this reason, the notation \\(u(\\beta)\\) is used in (5.9) rather than \\(u(\\widehat{\\beta})\\). Finally, a 95% credible interval \\([\\underline{\\beta},\\overline{\\beta}]\\) can be calculated from the posterior (5.7) which satisfies\r\\[\\begin{align}\r%\\intl{\\underline{\\beta}}{\\overline{\\beta}}{\\beta} \\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data}) =0.95.\r\\int_{\\underline{\\beta}}^{\\overline{\\beta}} \\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data}) \\mathrm{d} \\beta =0.95.\r\\tag{5.10}\r\\end{align}\\]\rEquation (5.10) does not uniquely determine a credible interval and further conditions need to be posed, for example that the credible interval is symmetric around the Bayes estimate, probabilistically symmetric, or of shortest length, cf. also [5].\n5.2.1 Informative prior\rBelow, \\(\\pi(\\beta)\\) denotes a PDF that models the prior knowledge about the measurand \\(\\beta\\). \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}_i^2\\) are the prior guesses of the variances \\(\\sigma_i^2, i=1, \\ldots, p\\), which have to be inferred. Assume that the reliability of these variance guesses can be expressed in terms of chosen coefficients of variations \\(c_i\\). In using inverse Gamma distributions to model such prior knowledge, the parameters \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) of the inverse Gamma distributions are then determined through\r\\[\\begin{align}\ra_i=2 + \\frac{1}{c_i^2},\\, b_i=(a_i-1) \\widehat{\\sigma}_i^2,\r\\tag{5.11}\r\\end{align}\\]\ri.e., the prior knowledge about each \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) is modeled by a distribution with mean \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}_i^2\\) and variance \\(c_i^2 (\\widehat{\\sigma}_i^2)^2\\). The resulting marginal posterior for the measurand is then obtained as\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data} ) \\propto \\pi(\\beta) \\prod_{i=1}^p t_{n_i-1+2a_i}\r\\left(\\beta; y_i/x_i, ((n_i-1)S_i^2+2b_i)/(n_i x_i^2[n_i-1+2a_i]) \\right),\r\\tag{5.12}\r\\end{align}\\]\rwhere \\(\\pi(\\beta)\\) denotes the prior PDF for \\(\\beta\\), and \\(t_{\\nu}(x;m,s^2)\\) stands for the PDF of a scaled and shifted \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom, i.e.\r\\[\\begin{align}\rt_{\\nu}(x; m, s^2) \\propto \\left( 1+ \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\frac{ (x-m)^2}{s^2} \\right)^{- \\frac{\\nu+1}{2}},\r\\tag{5.13}\r\\end{align}\\]\rcf. [5]. The univariate PDF (5.12) is easily evaluated, and the summary statistics (5.8)-(5.10) can immediately be obtained through standard procedures of numerical quadrature. Note that for evaluating (5.12) it is advantageous to calculate the logarithm of \\(\\pi(\\beta | \\mathrm{data})\\) first, and applying the exponential function afterwards.\nIn this example no true prior knowledge has been available. For the purpose of illustration, hypothetical prior knowledge in form of a normal distribution for \\(\\beta\\) with mean \\(1\\) and standard deviation \\(0.1\\) has been used, accompanied with guesses \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}_i^2\\) for the variances that have been taken as the observed variances \\(S_i^2\\). The reliability of the variance estimates was modelled by a coefficient of variation equal to unity, \\(c_i=1,i=1, \\ldots,p\\). Note that prior knowledge is information available before measurements are preformed. True prior knowledge will and shall not be deductions of observed data, as in this illustrative case.\n\u0026gt; # define log prior for b\r\u0026gt; logprior.b \u0026lt;- function(b) {\r+ -0.5 * ((b - mu.prior)^2)/sig2b.prior\r+ }\r\u0026gt;

The symbols in light gray display the estimate \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\) and \\(95\\%\\) coverage interval of the weighted least-squares approach for comparison.\r\r\r7 Discussion and recommendation\rThe results obtained by application of the GUM to ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation are different. This difference is due to the difference of the corresponding measurement models (4.3) used. Specifically, weighted least-squares estimation with weights \\(n_i W_i \\propto 1/u^2(y_i)\\) leads to a different estimate for the slope and a smaller uncertainty \\(u(\\widehat{\\beta})\\) than ordinary least-squares estimation. In fact, these weights are ``optimal’’ in the sense that they lead to a minimum uncertainty under all measurement models (4.3).\nOn the other hand, ordinary least-squares does not apply ``optimal’’ weights and results in a larger uncertainty associated with its different estimate for the measurand. Since the corresponding measurement model is linear in the data, the squared standard uncertainty provides an unbiased estimate of the variance of the ordinary least-squares estimator under hypothetical repeated sampling from the statistical model (4.4). From the perspective of the type A evaluation of the GUM, the corresponding uncertainty evaluation can thus be recommended. However, ordinary least-squares estimation utilizes a measurement model that does not account for the fact that different observations have different variability. That is, measurements are assigned the same weight although their variability differs by orders of magnitude.\nThe weighted least-squares estimate can be also be viewed as a solution to the statistical model (4.4) if the variances \\(\\sigma_i^2\\) were known. For unknown variances, however, the optimal weights \\(n_i W_i \\propto 1/ (\\sigma_i^2/n_i)\\) are also unknown. The uncertainties \\(u(y_i)\\) approximate the optimal weights \\(\\sigma_i/\\sqrt{n_i}\\), but they will generally be different – especially for a small number of repeated measurements. Some of the observations are weighted too high and, more importantly, are also treated by the GUM uncertainty evaluation as being more accurate than they actually are. Consequently, the resulting uncertainty associated with the weighted least squares estimate might be too small. This judgment is to be seen from a frequentist point of view, which corresponds to the view of the GUM with respect to type A evaluation.\nThe Bayesian uncertainty analysis is based on the statistical model (4.4) and does account for the different variability in the observations. At the same time, it does not use a single estimate of that variability to be used in a subsequent estimation of the measurand, but rather estimates the measurand and the variability in the observations simultaneously. Due to the straight-line model, all observations influence the estimation of all different variabilities in the observations, and observations with large variability will have less influence in the final result for the measurand. Furthermore, Bayesian inference allows prior knowledge about the measurand to be taken into account. For these reasons, we recommend the Bayesian uncertainty analysis for this example. It should be noted that also methods from classical statistics can be used to analyze the data on the basis of the statistical model (4.4) which has not been considered in this example.\nBayesian inference using our hypothetical informative prior yields very similar results to those using the noninformative prior. The reason is that the data overrule the prior information taken for the measurand, and that the (hypothetical) prior knowledge about the variances has been taken only vaguely and in accordance with the observed variances. If either of these two latter conditions for the prior of the variances is removed, the results of an informative Bayesian inference might look significantly different because each variance is modeled individually for each stimulus value and only a small number of repeated measurement results are available. In this case, the prior about for the variance will be more informative. In other applications it can be reasonable to assume a common variance, which would reduce the sensitivity with respect to the prior for the variance significantly. Furthermore, the proceeding provided for the Bayesian inference would then result in a single \\(t\\)-distribution for the measurand in the noninformative case, or the product of a single \\(t\\)-distribution and an informative prior for the measurand otherwise.\nWe emphazise that the statistical model (4.4) does not directly account for possible errors in the measurement results of the reference system. In fact, the example B2 of the guideline VDI/VDE 2600 part 2 [1] reports non-vanishing uncertainties for them. The statistical model (4.4) account for such an additional variability to a certain extent, as it includes unknown, individual variances for the dependent variable, that are simultaneously inferred together with the parameters of the straight line.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Nicolas Fischer (LNE) for reviewing, as well as Paola Pedone, Fabrizio Manta (ACCREDIA) and Alessandro Germak (INRIM) for commenting on the example.
